To compile an application, the dotnet tool requires a project file as well as one or more C# files. The following command scaffolds a new console project (creates its basic structure):

**dotnet new console -n  CreatingTypes**

To build and run your program, run the following command from the CreatingTypes folder:

**dotnet run CreatingTypes**

OR

dotnet build CreatingTypes.csproj
