## Compilation

create new project with dotnet CLI

    **dotnet new console -n Basics**

To build and run your program, run the following command from the Basics folder:

    **dotnet run Basics**

Or, if you just want to build without running:
**
    dotnet build Basics.csproj**

**Identifiers and Keywords**

Identifiers are names that programmers choose for their classes, methods, variables, and so on. Here are the identifiers in our example program, in the order in which they appear:
 **System x Console WriteLine**

Reserve Keyword
